Having more businesses nearby to propogate more business: Startups first, and then design companies, as recommended by the salary scores of developers and designers. Schools are vital to 30% of the company and are deal-breakers for some fo the older, high-level executives. Then comes Starbucks for all the executives, which is not hard to find and useful by score. Clubs and other nightlife allow younger employees to propogate a company culture that will attract the interest of nearby companies. \n",
